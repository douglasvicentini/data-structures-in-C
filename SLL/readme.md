## Simply Linked List (SLL)

A SLL consists of a linked list in which each node points to its next, based on the logical order in use. In this implementation, each node will contain a specific __id__ integer number. The list will be sorted in ascending order based on this __id__ attribute.

For instance, a node with id=1 can only point to a node with id>=2, if this node exists.
