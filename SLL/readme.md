## Simply Linked List (SLL)

This is a Data Structure in which each node points to the next on the SLL's logical order. 

In this implementation, each node will contain a specific ID integer number. The list will be sorted in ascending order.

For instance, a node with id = 1 will point to a node with id >= 2, if this node exists.
