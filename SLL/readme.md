## Simply Linked List (SLL)

A SLL consists of a linked list in which each node points to its next, based on the SLL's natural logical order.

In this implementation, each node will contain a specific ID integer number and the SLL will be sorted in ascending order.

For instance, a node with id=1 can only point to a node with id>=2, if this node exists.
