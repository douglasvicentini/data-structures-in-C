## About the repository

This project aims to present the implementation of some of the most common Data Structures, as well as some generic and simple algorithms for each one, such as insertion in order and removal by ID.

## Files

Every Data Structure has 3 separate files:

* __main.c__ : contains some simple use cases for each operation.;
* __"ds_name.c"__ : contains the code for every function and auxiliary function used for the operations on the data;
* __"ds_name.h"__ : contains the Abstract Data Type built for the Data Structure (both the data definitions and functions prototypes).

## Note

This project was only possible because of the classes I attended at the Informatics Institute at UFRGS (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do SUl), Brazil. The Institute's
