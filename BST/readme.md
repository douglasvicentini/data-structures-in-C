## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Search Tree is a type of Binary Tree in which each node located in the left subtree of its parent has a key value less than that of the parent, whereas each node located in the right subtree has a key greater than that of the parent and of its sibling.

In this implementation, the recursive functions use Pre-order traversal mode to traverse the tree.

For example, the following tree <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Binary_search_tree.svg/270px-Binary_search_tree.svg.png" alt="bst tree example" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> will be traversed and printed in the following way: 8-3-1-6-4-7-10-14-13.
